<br>

## Instructions
#### You must have the following items:
- An arduino UNO (or other model that is compatible with an ethernet shield)
- An Ethernet Shield with an SD card reader
- Ethernet Cable
- An HTM file on the SD card (so that the arduino sends it to the client)

You also need to install [this library](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoContinuousStepper "ContinousStepper by bblanchon") if you want to use the continous stepper like i did

This project was made for a school proyect, published to help other similar proyects and allow expansion of the concept :)
